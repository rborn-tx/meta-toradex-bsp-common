OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP Layer for Toradex Modules
================================================

This layer provides support for ARM based Toradex computer on modules (COM)
common to all used SoCs for use with OpenEmbedded and/or Yocto.
It is to be used together with meta-toradex-nxp and/or meta-toradex-tegra
layers.
For more information on available Toradex COMs please visit:

https://www.toradex.com/computer-on-modules

Note that the master branch of the layers is where the development is
happening. Do expect build breakage and do not expect us to give a solution.
If you need a more stable base use one of the release branches.
toradex-bsp-platform may have a master manifest tagged to specific layer
versions which likely is more stable than using HEAD.
